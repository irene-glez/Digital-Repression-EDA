### Hypothesis

We are going to study the relationship between democratic quality and digital repression. We want to answer questions like:
 - is it true that the least democratic countries are always the most repressive?
 - what exactly is digital repression?
 - what repressive methods characterize the different political regimes?
 - is there any relationship between the different types of digital repression?

# The 4 types of regimes

- Factors to measure the democracy index 'V-Dem Democracy Index': the index is based on two principles:

'Electoral' refers to how representative the system is, taking into account whether the elections are fair and free, and whether there are independent media in the country in question.

'Liberal' refers to measures on the rule of law and the rule of law, transparency, or civil liberties.


- Classification of regimes:
The V-Dem Democracy Index is used to characterize and classify political regimes. This is important in order to be able to detect when one enters or leaves each of them, that is, at what point democracy erodes and approaches autocracy, or, conversely, when a regime advances from autocracy towards democracy.

We then have 4 types of regimes:
- liberal democracies (LD)
- electoral democracies (ED)
- electoral autocracies (EA)
- closed autocracies (CA)

# World map according to regime

We have 179 countries in the dataset (currently there are 193, but 14 have limited international recognition).
However, it does seem to us a significant sample space, although discouraging: more than half of the countries are not democracies.
